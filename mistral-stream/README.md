What is your question? Can you explain LLM API streams in a couple of sentences?
LLM API streams refer to a feature in Language Learning Models (LLMs) that allows for continuous, real-time data processing and analysis. This means the model can handle a steady flow of input data, such as text or speech, and generate corresponding outputs, like translations or responses, without needing to wait for
 the entire data set to be processed at once. This feature enhances the model's efficiency and responsiveness in real-world applications.
